## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to Prisma!
Prisma is a control panel software stemming from the late CubedHost ([RIP 2011 - 2021](https://cubedhost.com)) that was originally created for a number of both business and user experience related reasons. Now that we're no longer operating under the need for the business reason, we're now working on what we had dreamed Prisma v2 to be; a project that was in the talks in the last 6 months of CubedHost's existence.

### Where are the repos?
While we're going to be an OSS project, initially we've decided to privatize the repositories until we've built our initial codebase, something that's presentable enough to say this is a super-early alpha. We have a lot of big plans with Prisma, but the architectural designs might not make a lot of sense right out of the gate becuase they're essentially two madmen's brainstorming sessions built over Rocket League.

### Is there an ETA?
Unfortunately, no. We want to work on this as a side project; it's absolutely not a day job anymore. That's what distracted us from the optimal experience to begin with. We both have 9-5 jobs in big tech, so it's absolutely possible that our day jobs of architectural software design and programming may very well delay us.

Even without a timeline, this isn't owned by big tech and, as one could probably expect, makes it easier to speed the project along from the start. We don't have any ideas of when we'll be ready, but do keep an eye out in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gvC8HgpS5G) for sneak peeks & streams!

### Will this continue to be a game server management platform?
Yes, in one way or another! We have some big ideas, which we'll show off soon(TM), but for now we're building and experimenting.

### Interested in helping?
Community contribution guidelines and other misc. details to come soon(TM)!
